# Summary

UD Turkish-German SAGT is a Turkish-German code-switching treebank that is developed as part of the [SAGT](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/projects/sagt/) project. 

# Introduction

The treebank consists of bilingual conversation transcriptions annotated with several
layers: language IDs, lemmas, POS tags, morphological features, and dependency
relations. Language IDs are described below.
The rest of the annotations follow the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme, and
the conventions used in monolingual Turkish and German treebanks. 

There are 48 distinct conversations from 17 participants.
The majority of the speakers are university students, hence the most
frequent age range is 18–25. Common conversation themes include studies, work,
travel, free time activities such as sports, books, TV, and future plans.

The accompanying audio recordings of transcriptions are also available as a speech corpus, with
a separate licence. Please contact ozlem@ims.uni-stuttgart.de for further information.

# Data Split

In total, there are 2184 sentences in the treebank. All sentences contain at least one intrasentential switch.
The data is split into train, development, and test sets, paying attention to conversation boundaries as well as a balanced theme and participant distribution.

# Language IDs

The treebank annotates two types of language IDs. The first one is stored as the `CSID` feature in the MISC column and follows the tag set of Çetinoğlu (2016). Each token has one of the following tags:

- TR: Turkish
- DE: German
- LANG3: Third language
- MIXED: Intra-word code-switching
- OTHER: Punctuation, numbers, emoticons, symbols etc.

The second type of language ID is stored as the `Lang` feature in the MISC column. With this feature, it is possible to use the UD validator to check language-specific constraints. The value of the feature is the ISO 639 code of the token's language in UD. It corresponds to

- 'tr' for TR tokens
- 'de' for DE tokens
- corresponding ISO codes for LANG3 tokens (e.g., 'en' for English)
- qtd, the language code of the SAGT treebank, for MIXED tokens
- no `Lang` feature for OTHER tokens
